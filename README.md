# Octo
A restful MERN app
//

A project built using MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, and NodeJs.
For a study program(Catalyst course) at Refactory Ug.
//

It accepts data from forms, stores the data in a database 
and avails the data when required or requested for.
Anything ranging from Employee data, client data and 
Even their salary calculations 
//

I hope 🤞🏼 you love it 😍
